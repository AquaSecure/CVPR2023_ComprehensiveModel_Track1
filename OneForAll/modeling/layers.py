def _convert_attention_mask(attn_mask, dtype):
    """
    Convert the attention mask to the target dtype we expect.
    Parameters:
        attn_mask (Tensor, optional): A tensor used in multi-head attention
                to prevents attention to some unwanted positions, usually the
                paddings or the subsequent positions. It is a tensor with shape
                broadcasted to `[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, sequence_length]`.
                When the data type is bool, the unwanted positions have `False` 
                values and the others have `True` values. When the data type is 
                int, the unwanted positions have 0 values and the others have 1 
                values. When the data type is float, the unwanted positions have 
                `-INF` values and the others have 0 values. It can be None when 
                nothing wanted or needed to be prevented attention to. Default None.
        dtype (VarType): The target type of `attn_mask` we expect.
    Returns:
        Tensor: A Tensor with shape s
