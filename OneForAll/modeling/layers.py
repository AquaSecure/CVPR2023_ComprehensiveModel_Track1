def _convert_attention_mask(attn_mask, dtype):
    """
    Convert the attention mask to the target dtype we expect.
    Parameters:
        attn_mask (Tensor, optional): A tensor used in multi-head attention
                to prevents attention to some unwanted positions, usually the
                paddings or the subsequent positions. It is a tensor with shape
                broadcasted to `[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, sequence_length]`.
                When the data type is bool, the unwanted positions have `False` 
                values and the others have `True` values. When the data type is 
                int, the unwanted positions have 0 values and the others have 1 
                values. When the data type is float, the unwanted positions have 
                `-INF` values and the others have 0 values. It can be None when 
                nothing wanted or needed to be prevented attention to. Default None.
        dtype (VarType): The target type of `attn_mask` we expect.
    Returns:
        Tensor: A Tensor with shape same as input `attn_mask`, with data type `dtype`.

class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Layer):
    """
    Attention mapps queries and a set of key-value pairs to outputs, and
    Multi-Head Attention performs multiple parallel attention to jointly attending
    to information from different representation subspaces.

    Please refer to `Attention Is All You Need <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf>`_
    for more details.

    Parameters:
        embed_dim (int): The expected feature size in the input and output.
        num_heads (int): The number of heads in multi-head attention.
        dropout (float, optional): The dropout probability used on attention
            weights to drop some attention targets. 0 for no dropout. Default 0
        kdim (int, optional): The feature size in key. If None, assumed equal to
            `embed_dim`. Default None.
        vdim (int, optional): The feature size in value. If None, assumed equal to
            `embed_dim`. Default None.
        need_weights (bool, optional): Indicate whether to return the attention
            weights. Default False.
