# Convention about Training / Test specific parameters

# Whenever an argument can be either used for training or for testing, the
# corresponding name will be post-fixed by a _TRAIN for a training parameter,
# or _TEST for a test-specific parameter.
# For example, the number of images during training will be
# IMAGES_PER_BATCH_TRAIN, while the number of images for testing will be
# IMAGES_PER_BATCH_TEST
