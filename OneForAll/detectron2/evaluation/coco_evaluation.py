    Evaluate AR for object proposals, AP for instance detection/segmentation, AP
    for keypoint detection outputs using COCO's metrics.
    See http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval and
    http://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval to understand its metrics.
    The metrics range from 0 to 100 (instead of 0 to 1), where a -1 or NaN means
    the metric cannot be computed (e.g. due to no predictions made).

    In addition to COCO, this evaluator is able to support any bounding box detection,
    instance segmentation, or keypoint detection dataset.

        Args:
            dataset_name (str): name of the dataset to be evaluated.
                It must have either the following corresponding metadata:

                    "json_file": the path to the COCO format annotation

                Or it must be in detectron2's standard dataset format
                so it can be converted to COCO format automatically.
            tasks (tuple[str]): tasks that can be evaluated under the given
                configuration. A task is one of "bbox", "segm", "keypoints".
                By default, will infer this automatically from predictions.
            distributed (True): if True, will collect results from all ranks and run evaluation
                in the main process.
                Otherwise, will only evaluate the results in the current process.
            output_dir (str): optional, an output directory to dump all
                results predicted on the dataset. The dump contains two files:

                1. "instances_predictions.pth" a file that can be loaded with `torch.load` and
                   contains all the results in the format they are produced by the model.
                2. "coco_instances_results.json" a json file in COCO's result format.
